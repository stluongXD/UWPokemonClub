            <h2>Topic Description</h2>
            <p> We want to make a website for the Pokemon Club at UW. This is important
                because the Pokemon club is a newly formed club and needs a website to
                gain visibility to other students. The website would also serve as a
                platform with information about the club, such as announcements,
                meeting times, and anything else related to Pokemon. Currently, there
                isnâ€™t a unified group or resource for UW students to talk or play Pokemon
                together so the website may be able to act as a catalyst to facilitate
                discussion and interaction.  There is currently not an easy way for club
                members to easily interact with each other aside from at club meetings.
                The Pokemon games also do not have a built in feature for users to contact
                or interact with each other so a web app will be needed to facilitate this
                interaction.  So users will be able to host their own content related to
                Pokemon such as facilitating their own discussion, join a tournament that
                another member is hosting, or even create events for the rest of the club
                to participate in.

            <h2>Potential Applications</h2>
            <p> There is a need for a website for the club to aggregate all of the club
                information to a single site so that students can easily learn about us.
                It also establishes a tight knit Pokemon community on campus. Our overarching
                goal of the website is to support discussion and community interaction involving
                Pokemon. Since it is a club website, we hope to include the basic information
                relating to the club such as announcement, contact information and meeting times.
                However, we also want students to freely discuss anything about Pokemon which may
                take form in a message board, where users can choose to personally message an officer
                or another member or the club or host a large discussion for anyone to participate in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another possible web application is a tool for users to host and create their own tournament
                bracket; a user can act as an admin to host and manage a tournament that will be listed on
                our website that creates a template for the tournament brackets. The admin can then specify
                the rules in the tournament (double elimination, 3 vs. 3, etc. ) and how each participant be
                paired to face off against each other (randomly, alphabetically, etc.). Other club members
                would be allowed to click a button to join the tournament bracket online.  The bracket will auto
                update to include the newly added participant to it. This will make organizing tournaments much
                more convenient for an everyday club member and also makes it easier for other club members to
                find people who would like to battle with them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our final idea for a web app is to create a group calendar where  members can post events on the
                calendar for everyone to do. For example, if a user wants to watch the Pokemon anime with other
                club members, then they can add an event to the group calendar of when they are available.
                The event post can include information such as location, time, and type of event (watching anime,
                playing games, etc.). Other users will then be able to see the event on the calendar and show interest
                in the event by favoriting the event (which they can find a list of favorite events at the bottom of
                the page), receive reminders to the events, and searching the calendar for events that contain keywords
                (such as tournament, or drawing contest, etc.) that the user is looking for.
